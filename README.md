# 2009 - Jellyfish (memories from my past)

A Web Scraper / File Downloader.

I was 19 years old at the time, Internet was still damn slow for enjoying P2P networks,
and I started looking for different strategies to download music and movies.

This project uses a specific web scraper to exploit misconfigured Apache servers which
allow directory listing.
